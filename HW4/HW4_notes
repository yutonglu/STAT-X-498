Nested design: Between (Factor) or Within (Time): use LMM
IN (C1, C2, C3, C4) ...
CO (C1, C2, C3, C4) ...

Crossed design (use ANOVA): 

In SPSS
Dependent variable:
-- Attention (HR) -- HR_Raw 
-- Emotion (fEMG) -- EMG_Raw1000
-- Arousal (SC) -- EDA_Raw

Independent variable:
RQ1: Article Prime -- News_Identity
RQ2: Ease of Categorization -- Ease_of_categorization
RQ3: Actual identity -- Actual_Identity
1, 2, 3 are categorical
RQ4: Transphobia -- Transphobia_GMC. "Will transphobia affect responses to advertisements 
when participants read news stories about modelsâ€™ transgender identities?"

RQ5 (optional): time
4, 5 are continuous

Time:
Continuous -- trend/pattern --> Growth Model
Categorical -- compare --> Independence or not


Explanation:
HR: attention
- decrease reflects focus (PSNS)
- increase reflects disengagement (SNS)

EDA: sweat response = autonomic arousal
- decrease reflects less arousal (PSNS)
- increase reflects more arousal (SNS)

Facial EMG: Corrugator associated with negative affect
EMG activity in response to out-group members is associated with behavioral outcomes
